# Medieval Blacksmith Demo

## Overview
The Medieval Blacksmith Demo is a Unity project designed to showcase fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, specifically Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Encapsulation. As part of the Unity Junior Programmer Pathway, this project aims to demonstrate the application of these principles in the context of creating a virtual blacksmith shop where various medieval weapons are sold.

`Unity version: 2021.3.22 LTS`

## Features
- **Abstraction:** Abstracting common functionalities, allowing for a streamlined and modular design.

- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulating the internal details of weapon properties and behaviors to ensure data integrity and facilitate easy maintenance.

- **Inheritance:** Utilizing inheritance to model relationships between different types of weapons, promoting code reusability and a hierarchical structure.

- **Polymorphism:** Implementing polymorphic behaviors to showcase the flexibility and extensibility of the weapon system.

## Weapon Showcase
The demo includes a variety of medieval weapons, each with its unique attributes such as name, description, weight, price, and damage. These weapons have been designed to illustrate the practical application of OOP principles within a game development environment.
